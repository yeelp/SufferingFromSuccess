This mod was developed for the 2025 1.12 Modding Coalition Mod Jam!

Minecraft mod where the more a mob dies, the stronger they get!

Similar to other difficulty based mods like [Scaling Health](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/scaling-health), killing mobs makes future mobs that spawn stronger! Compared to other difficulty based mods, SufferingFromSuccess applies bonuses on a *per entity basis*. Kill Zombies, and Zombies will spawn stronger than they were previously. But Creepers, Skeletons, and even Husks will remain as they are!

This also applies if mobs die from natural causes like fall damage or even from other mobs. This allows the benefits to still apply if the mob dies from things like a mob grinder or traps around your base.

SufferingFromSuccess applies bonuses as attribute modifiers based on the number of mobs killed of that type. Mobs will spawn with enhanced walking speed, swim speed, health, damage, follow range, and even spawn with additional absorption!

Some mobs get unique benefits from this system. Creepers will have stronger explosions and have a chance to spawn charged. Spiders have a higher chance to have a Skeleton rider. Skeletons and Blazes can shoot faster, Zombies will be more likely to call reinforcements, and Witches may start drinking stronger potions!

Bonuses that mobs receive are aggressive and by default are tweaked to be noticeable very quickly. However, if you stop killing those kinds of mobs, the strength of the bonuses they receive will decay exponentially over time until they no longer apply any more.
